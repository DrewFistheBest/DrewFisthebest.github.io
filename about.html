            <h2> <strong> Get to Know Me!</strong></h2>
            <p> I am very intrested in computers. Ever since I built my first computer I have been fasinated and always wanted to learn how they work and how there built. Thats one of the reasons why I want ot go into <strong>computer engineering</strong>. I am also really into playin board games and table top games. One of my all time favorite games is dungeons and dragons! I love to play it with friends and have all the ridiculous and hilarious stories. As I approach the end of high school I want want to go to college. I would like to be a computer engineer, specifically working on the parts of a computer, like the CPU, GPU, and RAM. I have always been intrested in computers and I have built one before. I am just facinated on how they work and the amazing things you can do with a bunch of on and off switches! Once of my favorite classes in school is actually math, I have always been good at math and loved it and since the fourth grade I have been in accelerated math class 2 years ahead of what kids around my age are doing.   </p>

            <h2> <strong>16 Personalities!</strong></h2>
            <p>We took the 16 personalities test for this about me section. I got the Assertive Architect, which is very accurate to what I saw my self as. The Architect is based on logic and the pursuit for knowledge, they use rational to and there nonstop anaylisis of the world to help them complete any task. Some of our greatest strenghts are our rational, indpendence, informed, determinded, curious, and versatile. Architects biggest flaws are arogannce, dissmissive with emotions, overly critical, and combatitive. Both of these very much resognate with me and my personalities. I find that my biggest strengths and weakness are all exactly those. </p>
