                    <p>Hello! My name is <em>Drew Faulstich</em>. I am a student at Plymouth Highshool in Plymouth Indiana. I am in intro to computer science principles! I am taking this class because I would like to persue computer engineering. Although I want to go on the hardware side of things. I want to learn how to code because I figure that I will have to learn alot of this anyways during colledge and it is best to have the beginning all sorted out. Not only that but I am going to take the AP test so hopefully I will get college credit for this class so I can even skip a class during college. </p>
