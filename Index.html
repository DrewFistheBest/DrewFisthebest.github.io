        <h1>All about Drew Faulstich!</h1>
        <h3> Who is Drew Faulstich?</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is <em>Drew Faulstich</em>. I am a student at Plymouth Highshool in Plymouth Indiana. I am in intro to computer science principles! I am taking this class because I would like to persue computer engineering. ALthough I want to go on the hardware side of things. I want to learn how to code because I figure that I will have to learn alot of this anyways during colledge and it is best to have the beginning all sorted out. Not only that but I am going to take the AP test so hopefully I will get college credit for this class so I can even skip a class during college. </p>
        <h3>My Intrests</h3>

        <p> I am very intrested in computers. Ever since I built my first computer I have been fasinated and always wanted to learn how they work and how there built. Thats one of the reasons why I want ot go into <strong>computer engineering</strong>. I am also really into playin board games and table top games. One of my all time favorite games is dungeons and dragons! I love to play it with friends and have all the rediculous and hilarious stories.  </p>
